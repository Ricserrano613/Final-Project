## About this game
I am an avid basketball fanatic, I have watched the NBA since I was a child and have loved anything related to basketball ever since (movies,video games, etc). 
I wanted to create a NBA 2k, NBA JAM inspired shootout game where the goal is to score as many points before the timer runs out. 


## Instructions 
Running this game is pretty simple, just click start and you are in the game! Hold the up arrow key on the keyboard to charge the shot! You may click anywhere on the court to position the ball! Good luck!
